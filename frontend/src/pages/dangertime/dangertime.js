Complex query:
6.2 Which zones (residential, commercial, or public) had the highest percentage increase 
in complaints at night time compared to day time?

For this query, the complaints can be divided by zone, and averages can be taken for day 
time complaints and night time complaints for each zone. The average volume can be mapped 
to the y-axis with day and night hours being as the x-axis. Then, the percentage increase 
would be taken between the volume of daytime complaints and volume of night time complaints, 
and this result can be compared for each zone.
